# About this Logbook
---
This is the `mdbook` version of our team's 'Engineering Notebook' to prove a point that markdown looks better and more consistent than any [word doc](https://highvale-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ma-0016_highvalesc_vic_edu_au/ESb_AO-PxuNLj0DIpg27JhABdKi--7eGi0Ls2AZsyzLKIQ?e=D0dWWG) could.
This logbook was written through me copy and pasting the contents from the word document and restructuring it to better fit a markdown book.
